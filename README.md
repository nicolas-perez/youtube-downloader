# youtube-downloader

Based on [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).

Youtube-dl is super complicated. I just want a program that I can fire up quickly, paste a few links inside a window, and download. 
This is the purpose of this script. 

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Change the value of `DESTINATION_FOLDER_ABSOLUTE_PATH` to whatever you like

## Usage

```bash
python youtube_downloader.py
```
